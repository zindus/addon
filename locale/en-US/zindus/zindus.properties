zindus.statusFailOnGdConflict1=\nSometimes you have to do a little "cleaning" of your Thunderbird addressbook before it will sync.\n\nGoogle has a requirement that an email address can appear in only one contact.  Your intervention is needed at this point because in your Thunderbird addressbook, the email address(es) listed below appear in more than one contact.\n\nThe easiest way to resolve this is: for each address, decide which contact is your preferred version, then delete the other one.  Before deleting contacts, update the preferred versions with any information that you want to keep.\n\nIf you open the Thunderbird Addressbook before coming here, you can have both windows open at the same time.  Be sure to check both the "Email" and "Additional Email" fields.

zindus.statusFailOnGdForbidden=Unable to proceed.  This is might be because you are logging in with your Google Account email address.  Suggest using your Gmail email address instead.

zindus.statusFailOnGdConflict2=\nSometimes you have to do a little "cleaning" of your Thunderbird and Google addressbooks before they will sync.\n\nGoogle has a requirement that an email address can appear in only one contact.  Your intervention is needed at this point because in your Thunderbird and Google addressbooks, the email address(es) listed below appear in more than one contact or in different contacts.\n\nThe easiest way to resolve this is: for each address, decide which of Thunderbird or Google has your preferred version, then delete the other one.  Before deleting contacts, update the preferred versions with any information that you want to keep.  The preferred contacts will then sync to the other side.\n\nIf you open the Thunderbird Addressbook before coming here, you can have both windows open at the same time.  Be sure to check both the "Email" and "Additional Email" fields in Thunderbird.\n\nOnce you've done this, the next sync should succeed.

zindus.statusFailOnGdEmptyContact=\nSometimes you have to do a little "cleaning" of your Thunderbird addressbook before it will sync.\n\nGoogle does not allow contacts to be completely empty.  There are some contacts in your Addressbook which may look non-empty in Thunderbird but when translated to Google are empty.\n\nTo fix this, you can edit the corresponding contacts in the Addressbook or move them into a different addressbook so that they aren't synced with Google.\n\nTo help you locate these contacts in the Addressbook, here are their attributes:
